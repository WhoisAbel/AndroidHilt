#### **Course Objective:**

Introduction to Dependency Injection using Hilt.

#### **Target Audience:**

This course is great for people who already use dagger **or people who struggled with the steep dagger learning curve** and want something a little easier.

Hilt is built on top of dagger and designed to be easier to use.

#### **Prerequisites:**

I think any intermediate+ developer will benefit from this course. Hilt is much simpler to use than dagger.
